# Golang_notes
Notes taken during learning Go lang

**Why GO**
- Go is written for multiple cores. To take advantage of multipe cores and is designed to do that. Concurrecy is also easy in go by design. Its compiled language. So very fast, as its converted to binary before executing. Its garbage collected, clean syntax and powerful std library

- It complies in many machines, compile once run every where. Open source by google.

- go lang playground to live check the code working..

- generally semi colons are not inserted by user. They are automatically inserted by compiler. we can add semi colons if we need them or to help the compiler. 

- firt line in the go file needs to be the package declartion. Then comes the import statement. then the main function that needs to run.

- golang is the standard package site. Godoc has third party packages as well..

- its preferable to keep a single workspace for go code. A single folder having all code that we write, This allows us easy package management and namespacing. So there wont be any conficts. Third party librarires come with this structure. so be used to it.

- if using a third party package, we need to use the entire package name, while std packages needs just the name. One of the reason while package strucutre is important. Clear separation of packages and namespaces.

- definitely set the gopath to your workspace and goroot to where we installed go.. go path defines where the pacakges we pull wll be saved.

- file with main fn can be named anything.. Not jut main...but nice to do that so we can easily identify.
