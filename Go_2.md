**Data Types**

- Go’s typ es fal l into four categories: basic ty pes, aggregate ty pes, reference types, and interface
ty pes. Basic typ es, the topic of this chapter, include numbers, str ings, and boole ans. Aggregate
types—ar rays (§4.1) and str ucts (§4.4)—form more complic ated dat a types by combining values
of several simpler ones. Reference typ es are a diverse group that includes pointers (§2.3.2),
slices (§4.2), maps (§4.3), functions (Chapter 5), and channels (C hapter 8), but what they have
in common is that they al l refer to program variables or state indirectly, so that the effec t of an
operat ion applie d to one reference is obs erved by all copies of that reference.
